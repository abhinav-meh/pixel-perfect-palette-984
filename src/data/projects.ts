      "Physical models that cast precise, unexpected shadows through stereographic projection—only when light hits one exact point.",
    fullDescription:
      "These physical models execute the mathematical concept of stereographic projection in an artistic form. When light is positioned at one specific point relative to the sculpture, it casts a precise and unexpected shadow—only when the light is in that exact position.\n\nUsing a combination of CAD and computational design tools (Processing, Grasshopper, TouchDesigner), I designed and 3D-printed the models.\n\nThese are prototypes! I'm currently expanding and refining this concept for my graduate thesis. Larger models, refined finishes, and interactive components will hopefully come together for an exhibition in May 2026.\n\n**What is Stereographic Projection?**\n\nStereographic projection is a mathematical technique that maps points from the surface of a sphere onto a flat plane. Imagine a globe with a light source at the North Pole—the shadows cast by points on the sphere's surface create corresponding points on a flat surface below. This projection preserves angles and creates beautiful, often surprising geometric relationships between the curved and flat worlds. While it distorts sizes (things get larger the farther they are from the projection point), it maintains the shapes of small features, making it both mathematically elegant and visually striking.",

The centerpiece is a 3×3-foot 3D-printed map, assembled from multiple sections and hand-painted, with over 300 integrated LEDs highlighting significant water-related geography and locations. The exhibit also includes a matching educational wall.\n\nThis project was developed through We Are Water, a program under CU Boulder's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. We collaborated with a local library in Alamosa and community members to ensure the exhibit would be meaningful to the community. Working with three other students, my primary roles included printing, assembling, and painting the map; operating CNC machines for laser-cutting wood and acrylic; prototyping; woodworking; and general assembly, electronics, painting, and gluing.\n\nA second custom topographic map was also created for the Hopi Native Reservation. At the community's request, no further photos or information are shared here.",

      "Working as an intern and then assistant, I helped Denver artist Sammy Lee fabricate pieces for her solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Denver. My work included helping build a giant microphone from scaffolding to finished surface, where we applied paper casting—one of Sammy's signature techniques—to the exterior. For another piece featuring a repurposed airline seat, I helped adorn it in foil tape and disco mirror mosaic, then custom-integrated sensors that allow viewers to interact with the piece and activate special lighting. I also integrated LED lights and buttons into one of Sammy's existing works.",

With the right sleight of hand, this piece makes for an entertaining party trick.",

    fullDescription:
      "Inspired by the inverse curvature of hyperbolic geometry, I set out to visualize what a beehive might look like in this non-Euclidean space. To create such a large origami piece with a precise fold pattern, I experimented with laser cutting, finding settings that scored the pattern onto paper without cutting through. This approach made the process more efficient and accurate. I finished the piece by hand-painting gold pigments against the black paper to evoke dripping honey, and added an origami bee for a playful touch.\n\nI created a second piece in summer 2025 that now lives in one of the themed rooms at the Human Design Hotel in Montreal, Canada.",

I then integrated magnets into the wood and inserted them into a sewn shell. The final piece is easy to store and, thanks to the magnets and geometric design, can support up to 200 lbs.",
